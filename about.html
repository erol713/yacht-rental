					<h3>What We Do</h3>
					<p>Europe Yacht Charter has an array of yacht and boats on charter services available to you around the year. Yachts of all sizes and shapes grace the Mediterranean, some are large motor yachts, some are sleek sailing yachts, some performance orientated and others of a more comfortable cruising style. This fabled luxury yacht charter area provides the untamed extravagance of the French Riviera, the gravity-defying architecture of the Italian coasts, the unaffected charms of Croatia, the fragrant orange groves of Spain, the exotic lure of Turkey and Greece, the birthplace of civilization. The Mediterranean luxury yacht charter area takes in the Tyrrhenian, Ionian, Aegean and Adriatic seas. It includes the austere and striking islands of Sardinia, Corsica, the Balearics and Malta. Some of the most famous private yacht charter spots include Monaco, Nice, Cannes, St Tropez, Capri, Portofino, Amalfi, Positano, Porto Cervo, Palma de Mallorca, Valencia, Barcelona, Dalmatians, Corfu, Mykonos, Piraeus, Bodrum and Marmaris, to name a few. And some of the charter boat countries bordering the Mediterranean include France, Spain, Italy, Croatia, and Greece. </p>
